This program utilizes Selenium and Python to check for new avalible studies on the UCalgary SONA Research Participation System (RPS) website. Every 7 minutes, the website is checked and users are notified of new studies using the DiscordWebhooks API. Through the use of this program, students can bypass the challange of constantly checking the website for new studies, and several hundred students in a course can be quickly informed of a new study over Discord.
